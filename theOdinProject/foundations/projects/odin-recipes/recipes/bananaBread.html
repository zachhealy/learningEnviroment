    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Banana bread has been a longstanding tradition and treat in the Healy household. 
        Both on wonderfully warm fall days, but also fridgid cold winters, banana bread
        always seemed to make an appearance. Over the years my mom has perfected the recipe
        and now I'll be sharing them here, for the world to see.

    <p>
        Just to make a side note about it, this is a recipe that you can have a lot of fun with
        if you're really into bananas, then go ahead and add some extra! Think it needs to be
        sweeter, maybe some more sugar is your route. This recipe isn't an exact science, so
        just have fun with it!
